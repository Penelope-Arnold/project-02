# Zoom

As a user you are able to create an account login and post your trips to be saved to your own unique user profile. You are also able to see the many posts of other users and save them as future trips you would like to go on. 

* Only one member of each group should complete this activity while the others watch.

* Copy the entire [Unsolved](Unsolved) folder to another location on your computers &mdash; wherever you would like your local copy of the group project to be.

* Rename the copied "Unsolved" folder to the name of your project.

* Open the copied project folder's `package.json` file and change its `name` property to the name of your project.

* CD to the root of the copied project folder with your terminal and run the following commands:

  ```
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  ```

* Then copy the GitHub repo's remote SSH URL (the same URL you'd use to clone the repo).

* Run the following commands in your terminal, replacing <remote-url> with your GitHub repo's remote SSH URL.

  ```
  git remote add origin <remote-url>
  git push origin master
  ```

* If completed successfully you should see all of the files uploaded to GitHub.

* All other group members should now clone the repo.

* Discuss as a group:

  * How would you now add changes to this project?
